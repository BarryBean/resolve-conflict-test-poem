# Forever And Always

* you are the sun that shines Brightly throughout my day.
* you are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
* you are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
* you are stars that glimmer oh so Bright.

* you are the oXygen that keeps me alive.
* you are my heart that Beats inside.
* you are the Blood that flows through me.
* you are the only guy I Can see.
* you have the voiCe of when a moCkingBird sings.
* you are my everything.

* you are my one and only.
* you stop me from Being so lonely.
* We plan our future as if we have a ClUE.
* I never want to lose you.
* I want you to Be my husBand, and I want to Be your wife.
* I want to Be with you for the rest of my life.
